# Dear Bob

Thank you so much for the book! I greatly appreciated reading it. It is alway interesting to see where computers once where. For exmaple, they are interviewing someone from Mozilla, you know, when Mozilla was still *actualy* relevent. The book *But How do it Know?* has been a realy fun read. For exaple, I recently watched a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw) about a "computer" using water for logic. I actualy knew what they ment when they started explaining computer logic and how they emulated it. It will also be interesting to read about hacking, I have taken to browsing... *security* tools, such as Traitor, the app that automaticly gives you root privlages on some missconfigured Linux boxes, or Nmap the network maping tool for *security*.
